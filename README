=CSS Janus=

_Flips CSS from LTR to an RTL orienation and vice-versa_

Author: `Lindsey Simon <elsigh@google.com>`

==Introduction==

CSS Janus is designed to help in the conversion of a website's layout from 
left-to-right(LTR) to right-to-left(RTL) by providing a CSS parser which will
change property names and values accordingly. This script alone is of course
not enough to take a website from a LTR language to a RTL one all the way.
There are many bidirectional text formatting issues that this script cannot 
fix, but it is a start. This script was born out of the need to convert some
layouts to RTL when tables are not being used for layout.

==Getting the code==

View the trunk at:

  http://cssjanus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Check out the latest development version anonymously with:

{{{
  $ svn checkout http://cssjanus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cssjanus
}}} 

==Using==

Usage:
  ./cssjanus.py < file.css > file-rtl.css
Flags:
  --swap_left_right_in_url: Fix "left"/"right" string within urls.
  Ex: ./cssjanus --swap_left_right_in_url < file.css > file_rtl.css
  --swap_ltr_rtl_in_url Fix "ltr"/"rtl" string within urls.
  Ex: ./cssjanus --swap_ltr_rtl_in_url < file.css > file_rtl.css
  

If you'd like to make use of the bundled django webapp version of cssjanus,
you'll need to edit django_settings and set the TEMPLATE_DIRS variable
to the absolute path of the cssjanus checkout. Next, edit django_run.sh and
change the PYTHONPATH. You should then be able to fire up the local dev 
server simply by running "./django_run.sh runserver" from the command line.

==Bugs, Patches==

Patches and bug reports are welcome, just please keep the style
consistent with the original source. If you find a bug, please include a diff
of cssjanus_test.py with the bug included as a new unit test which fails. It
will make understanding and fixing the bug easier.

==Todo==

* Come up with a way to tell cssjanus to ignore some particular className(s).
* Include some helpers for some typical bidi text solutions.
